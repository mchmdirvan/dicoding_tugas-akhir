## 🗒️About The Project

This project was created as a submission for the Dicoding task, aiming to implement an attractive and responsive landing page.  I create a landing page for a hospital company profile. The main focus is on creating an engaging user interface by following the provided guidelines:

### Design Principles

- **Attractive UI:** The project focuses on creating an aesthetically pleasing user interface.
- **Color Palette:** The color scheme is carefully chosen to match the theme of the application. Tools like [colorhunt.co](https://colorhunt.co/) were utilized for color selection.
- **Layout:** The layout is designed for optimal user experience, ensuring that content is well-organized and doesn't overlap.
- **Fonts:** Appropriate fonts are chosen to align with the overall theme.
- **Padding and Margin:** Proper padding and margin are implemented for a clean and well-structured design.

### Responsiveness

- **Responsive Layout:** The project ensures a responsive design using media queries to adapt to various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **No Content Overlap:** Care is taken to prevent content from stacking or overflowing the container on different devices.

### JavaScript Implementation

The project incorporates JavaScript to enhance user interactions and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM).
